- select main script
- parameterize script
	- specify mandatory where approprate, parameter types, validation, etc.
	- ensure that code expects given types, not just strings for each param
	- still need to parameterize $upgradeESXiTo65a variable
- integrate other scripts' functionality into updated script
- updated creation of ESXi VMs to do single Import, rest as clones?
- update VSS/VDS support to not require user to specify vSwitch type (just try Get-VirtualPortgroup, and in catch, do Get-VDPortGroup)
	- handle this by updating code to not rely on following (when parameterizing code, did not include this as a param):
	# General Deployment Configuration for Nested ESXi, VCSA & NSX VMs
	$VirtualSwitchType = "VDS" # VSS or VDS
- add support for ShouldProcess() (replacing confirmation with standard PowerShell -WhatIf support)
- optimize/standardize -- update PowerShell aliases with full command names
